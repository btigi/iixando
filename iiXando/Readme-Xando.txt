+) Section 1. About
===================
  Xando is a Total Conversion (TC) for the Infinity Engine. The TC is designed for the BG2: ToB revision of the engine.
  While not a true TC (several graphics are re-used from the original game, notably the interface artwork), Xando offers a completely different gaming experience.
  Xando has been created for the sheer experience of creating a TC in a single day. Xando is the only IE TC I know of that's been created in 1 day. In fact, it's the only TC for any game I know of that been created in such a short amount of time. It may not be the most complex game around, but it's something new to the IE, and perhaps will show a way forward from the current state of modding.

 To reach the new content, you must start a new SoA game and process through character generation as normal. Once character generation is complete, you should begin Xando.

  If there is any interest, I may continue work on Xando. 

+) Section 2. Requirements
==========================
  Xando REQUIRES ToB. It is recommended that the latest BG2:ToB patch (v. 26498) is also installed.

+) Section 2. (un)Installation
